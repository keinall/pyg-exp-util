Some Simple Pygame Utilities and Experimental Code

by Keinall aka Golden Ken Saiyan ;) 

This will have to remain empty until I set up git locally again, 
since I had to change the HDD in my main dev box and decided to
cross-grade to OEM version of Windows 7 from the vendor supplied
version. Long irrelevant story justifies why, but it saved
time and increased my peace of mind. 

This will include silly little utilities that I use when
developing code in pygame (Python 3.4 with Pygame 1.9.2,
32-bit x86 version, tested under the stone ceiling of Windows 7 64-bit).

Why do I use a 32-bit Python on a 64-bit OS? Because more compatibility;
I might even regress to Python 2.7 if I get any problems.

That change of the print command to a print function, for example,
was a bloop thing for the pythonners to do. Ick and phtuey on them.
